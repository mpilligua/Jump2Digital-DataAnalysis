# Jump2Digital-DataAnalysis

In this repository we include 2 different files. 
- crear_basedatos.ipynb: Used to clean and prepare the data for the back and front end solution 
- transformacion_analysis.ipynb: Where we analyze try to find patterns and implement algorithms to find relations

Interesting plots and analysis extracted


** Correlation matrix between the different barris of barcelona in terms of locals of each sectors, habitants, density, price to rent a local, medium income per habitant.**

### Example of use
Imagine I want to open a new local in "la Barceloneta", this app would give you information like:

Futhrer more we can analyze the current number of locals we have per sector

And compare it with the other barris in barcelona (the mean of all the other barris)

From here we can extract data like: There is a need of automoci√≥ bussiness compared to other barcelona barris, which can be useful information to decide what kind of bussiness we want to open

### Recomendation of other barris
From this data we can also implement a recomendator that can compute the similarity between barris in the terms of features related to bussines activity, which can be a useful information to compare different alternatives.

In a future implementation we can implement a complete recommender system that ranks not only barris but locals based on your preferences making even easier the task of opening a new bussines and fomenting overall "comerci local".
